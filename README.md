# BSc Thesis - ATIA: Automated Tongue Image Analysis for Autoimmune Disease Detection

This thesis aims to identify the best supervised machine learning or deep learning model for diagnosing autoimmune diseases through automated image analysis of tongue images.

### Objectives
- Develop a model for accurately diagnosing autoimmune diseases.
- Conduct automated image analysis on tongue images.
- Evaluate the performance of different machine learning and deep learning models.

### Approach
- **Data Collection**: Gather tongue images for analysis.
- **Model Development**: Train and evaluate supervised machine learning models.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare models to determine the best performer.
